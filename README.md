## A thing Tommy's brother did for Simon

This is dumb and I'm sure I could make it way way faster and simpler if I got around to learning regex properly but I mostly did it to get the idea out of my head and also to play around with streams, which I've never used before and which I probably didn't even need in this case. Maybe I'll improve it as a way to learn regex.
