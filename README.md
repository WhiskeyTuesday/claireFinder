# claireFinder
## A thing Tommy's brother did for Simon

This is dumb and I'm sure I could make it way way faster and simpler if I got around to learning regex properly but I mostly did it to get the idea out of my head and also to play around with streams, which I've never used before and which I probably didn't even need in this case. Maybe I'll improve it as a way to learn regex.

### Usage

running the file with `node claireFinder.js` will create a text file called possibleClaireNumbers.txt in the directory from which you run it... or maybe in the directory where the js file is. I'm not actually sure what the behaviour would be if you ran it from outside. Anyway, you'd already know that if you looked at the code; it's only like 60 lines and you really shouldn't exec random code from github without reading it first. Remember to try all the relevant area codes!
